# TF-Azure

This is my first intial project with Terraform.

I had been learning Terraform through the udemy course. Now I wished to apply on what I learned. Cover in this project, I will do the following
- Set up an Azure link to Terraform
- Deploy a select resource through Terraform

This is a working in progress and may not be fully complete. I wish to add more into this github repository when it is done.
